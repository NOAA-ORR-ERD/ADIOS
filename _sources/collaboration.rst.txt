Collaboration
#############

It is our intent to collaborate as much as possible in this project. We have seen a lot of interest in a open oil database for response, and are hoping that people will work with us during the design process, and then it will be more likely to meet as many people's needs as possible.

Opportunities for Collaboration
===============================

We seek input any help with virtually every part of the project. Depending on your interests, here are some of the ways in which you might participate:

* Helping define the data model -- what should be in a oil record?

* Providing data: oil assays that you would like to see in the database

* Helping write / test / debug the code. We will have early versions posted on gitHub, so if you want it to integrate better with your workflow or software, we're open to any new features, etc.

* Anything else!

How to Participate
==================

We do not yet have any formal process for participation, so your best bet is to contact CHrhis Barker at: Chris.Barker@noaa.gov, and we can go from there.

Also, this document, and any code, etc, are all managed on gitHub at:

You are welcome to create Issues to ask questions or start a conversation, or, if you are a gitHub geek -- fork and create a Pull Request with changes to documentation or code, or ...
